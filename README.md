# joriem.me
Dali Dev Challenge

This is my personal website, which I created as part of my application to be a Developer in the DALI Lab at Dartmouth College. 

## Description
This site builds a personal website, which provides a bit of information about myself. It is primarily built in HTML and CSS, but utilizes React components on the "about" page to create an interactive quiz!

It is made up of three pages, a homescreen, an about page, and a page with additonal links.
